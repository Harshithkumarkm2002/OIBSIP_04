Email Spam Detector
Overview
This project aims to build an email spam detector using Python and machine learning techniques. The goal is to train a model to recognize and classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content. Spam emails often contain unsolicited messages, scams, or phishing attempts, and this tool helps users filter out unwanted communication.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the email dataset for analysis.
Machine Learning Model: Implements a classification algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) to identify spam emails.
Predictive Functionality: Allows users to input email content and receive predictions on whether it is spam or ham.
Visualization: Provides graphical representations of model performance through metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of emails labeled as "spam" or "ham." Each email is represented by a text message, with corresponding labels indicating its category. The dataset can be sourced from Kaggle or other platforms.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-detector.git
cd email-spam-detector
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To use the email spam detector, run the following command in your terminal:
python spam_detector.py

Model Evaluation
The performance of the spam detector is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the classification results.
